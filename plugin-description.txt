Are you using OkCupid? You should definitely be using this extension.
** Hey everyone, your developer here. Every day, more and more people are using this extension. That's wonderful! But I don't have as much free time as I wish I did. Feel free to email with requests and bug reports, and if you want to help with developing the plugin, let me know! -Ben **

This extension improves OkCupid:
* User thumbnails enlarge when you mouse over them.
* You can also see categories that other users fall into right on their profile page. Categories include (but are not limited to):
** Dietary Restrictions (ex. Vegetarian-Friendly)
** Discrimination (ex. race, LGBT, weight)
** Demeanor (ex. generally happy, not volatile)
** Drugs (ex. smoking, 420-friendly, hard drugs)
** Relationship Model (ex. non-monogamous, communicative, wanting/not wanting children)
** Science/Faith (ex. science-friendly, spiritual, religious)
** Sex (ex. rough/kinky, BDSM, masochism, dom/sub, bondage)
** Sexuality (ex. bi-open, sex-positive)

If you like the plugin, I'd love to hear from you. It's a 100% free plugin, and I'm building it entirely in my spare time, so positive feedback and ideas are what fuel me. If you have any ideas for questions or categories that you want to see added, email me.

Thanks everyone!
-Ben


Note for Geeks: If you want to make custom categories, you'll have to do some data file hacking. I'm sorry I can't provide support for those of you who try, but I can say if you do, make a backup of your changes. Every time I update the plugin, it will overwrite your modifications.
